Simple front-end application that retrieve data from an API and show all the clients interactions percentages for every sectors.

### API http://substantiveresearch.pythonanywhere.com/

## Project Approach

1- I started with the HTML architecture

2- I fetched all the data from the API with Async Await Promises and I printed all the data to saw the result on the console

3- I used Map and Set to find all the unique Sectors and I used a Foreach to loop through
the total sectors and find all the percentages for each sector

4- I used some DOM manipulation to populate the frontend HTML

5- I added some basic CSS styles

## Considerations

I decided to don't use any CSS pre-processor and any HTML, javaScrip framework cause we have just few line of code and could be confusing and less readable.

## Things to do

- Improve UI
- Add error message on the UI
- Making the application more responsive on mobile devices.
